### Data Discovery (EDA)

Skewness value: it can be used to measure the asymmetry of probability distribution of random variables.

Kurtosis value: it can be used to measure the steepness of the probability distribution of random variables.

First, observe the rent data. It can be seen that this data is in  line with the normal distribution, but the skewness value is too large.  We found a big tail. The "rent" value distribution has obvious skewness, so we will correct it later.

(2) View the data histogram of each property of the apartment

Next, let's take a look at the impact of some important attributes  on the results The histogram is used to show the data distribution. Generally speaking, it refers to which piece of data accounts for a high proportion or  number of occurrences, and which piece has a low probability of  occurrence. The following figure shows the occurrence of 18 attributes

Continuous variables include: community name (Cname),  rent_quantity, total floors, position, subway_station, distance, rent,  and the rest are discrete variables.

(3) For discrete variables, we use boxplot to represent (box plot) Discrete variables include time, floor, space, state, bedroom_num, hall_num, toilet _num Rent_style, area, subway_line, decoration.

(4) Correlation analysis

Analyze the correlation degree between different factors affecting  housing price and housing price, and analyze the correlation degree  through the correlation graph. Qualitative and visual analysis of the correlation between different  factors affecting housing price and housing price with bar chart

### Data cleaning

Because the data may be incomplete, noisy, random, and have complex data structures, it is necessary to preliminarily sort out the data,  clean the incomplete data, make preliminary description and analysis,  select variables related to data mining, or change variables.

### Deviation correction

Normal distribution transformation: the tail behind is too long,  and it needs to be corrected (logarithmic transformation of data)

For attributes with too large missing data, you can choose to  discard them, and for attribute data with small missing data, you can  fill them:

(1) Delete the missing data (decoration situation, state, rent_style)

all_ data. drop(['decoration situation'], axis=1, inplace=True)

all_ data. drop(['state'], axis=1, inplace=True)

all_ data. drop(['rent_style'], axis=1, inplace=True)

(2) The three columns of "subway line", "subway station" and  "distance" represent the subway situation near the house. According to  different data types, the distance column filled with "1" represents  unlimited distance, and the first two columns filled with "0" represent  no subway station and subway line

all_ data["distance"]=all_ data["distance"].fillna(1)

all_ data["subway_line"]=all_ data["subway_line"].fillna(0)

all_ data["subway_station"]=all_ data["subway_station"].fillna(0)

(3) The number of rented houses in the community contains a small  number of vacancies, which shall be filled with the average value

mean_ val = all_ data["rent_quantity"].mean()

all_ data["rent_quantity"] = all_ data["rent_quantity"].fillna(mean_val)

(4) There are few vacant values of "position" and "area", which are category variables and filled with mode.

mode_ area = all_ data["area"].mode()

mode_ position = all_ data["position"].mode()

all_ data["area"] = all_ data["area"].fillna(int(mode_area))

all_ data["position"] = all_ data["position"].fillna(int(mode_position))
