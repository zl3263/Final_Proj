## Motivation

New to New York City, our group members are all shocked by the high cost of building rentals. This encourages us to explore more about the property market and the buildings' price in NYC.

We are curious about the distribution of buildings of each pricing level in time and geographical zones. Also, we want to find factors that may have influence on buildings value. Based on which, we can further modeling and predicting the buildings price in New York.

## Planned Analysis

We plan to conduct following work in our project: 

- Preprocessing: Data cleaning and transforamtion.
- Exploratory Analysis: Include visualization of a single variable and relationship between variables.
- Statistical Analysis: Based on hypothesis testing to find factors that may have influence on the buildings' marked value.
- Modeling: Predicting building's value based 
- Project our findings to interactive webpage.


## Data Source

### Cooperative Comparable Rental Income

To attain the price information of buildings, we use the dataset published by the Department of Finance of NYC. The origin data can be acquired from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DOF-Cooperative-Comparable-Rental-Income-Citywide-/myei-c3fa)

This dataset contains the income and expense statements of condominium and comparable rental buildings in NYC that helps people estimate the marked value of their own buildings. In each observations, a condominium/cooperative is compared with three rental buildings that have similar physical and geographical features.  We equaly treat these two kind of buildings and transformed the data shape to ensure that each observation records exactly one building.

### Sources for data

This data is a forecast of apartment rent competition data, which is  from Kaggle. The apartment rent is predicted by apartment information published on  the Internet, such as room layout, quantity, text description, photos,  price, etc. The apartments are located in New York City.

The data is from the forecast apartment rent competition:  (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DOF-Cooperative-Comparable-Citywide-/myei-c3fa)



## Analysis purpose

Use the historical data with monthly rent tags to establish different models, realize the prediction of monthly housing rent based on basic  housing information, and provide an objective measurement standard for  the city's rental market.



## Analyze the problem

This project will use the training set data as the sample training  model, use different models to predict the rent according to the  prediction set data, compare the performance of different models  according to the result error, and hope to determine the model  applicable to the monthly housing rent prediction.
